**OblivionBC/OblivionBC** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
I am a Computer Science Student at UBC and Software Developer in Test at BC Pension Corporation.
I have been programming for ~4 years and C++, and Javascript are my favourite languages.
Web Development and Game Development are what I enjoy working on most.
Thanks for checking my page out, and feel free to contact me with any inquiries about my projects or myself :)
