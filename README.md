### Hi there ğŸ‘‹ My Name is Connor

<!--
**OblivionBC/OblivionBC** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Project Jump! A 2D platformer that I am creating with my team for my Software Engineering class!
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Software Development practices and Unreal Engine
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any sort of Games, or crossplatform/web apps.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about my dog Skye or Track and Field :)
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am a nationally ranked track and field athlete and am pretty good at cooking (I think)
